# Commands And Runtime Params

This doc covers the CLI entry surface and the runtime-parameter system.

## Primary Sources

- `AGENTS.md`
- `commands/AGENTS.md`
- `space.js`
- `commands/serve.js`
- `commands/params.yaml`
- `server/lib/utils/runtime_params.js`

## CLI Entry

The CLI entry file is `space.js`.

Current behavior:

- dynamically lists `commands/*.js`
- normalizes `--help` -> `help`
- normalizes `--version` -> `version`
- imports the chosen command module dynamically
- expects each command module to export `execute(context)`

Important note:

- `space.js` is still legacy CommonJS
- the rest of the repo prefers ES modules
- treat that CommonJS entry as migration debt, not a pattern to copy

## Current Command Families

Operational commands:

- `serve`
- `help`
- `get`
- `set`
- `version`
- `update`

Runtime-state commands:

- `user`
- `group`

`node space user create` can add the new user to groups in the same command with `--groups <group[,group...]>`. The group list is comma-separated, normalized, de-duplicated, and written through the same `L1` group helper used by `node space group add`.

`node space group add` creates the target writable `L1` group if it does not already exist, including predefined runtime group ids such as `_admin`.

The command tree prefers a small number of readable top-level commands with explicit subcommands instead of many tiny files.

## `update`

`node space update` updates a source checkout from the canonical Space Agent repository.

Current behavior:

- before fetching, it pins `origin` to `https://github.com/agent0ai/space-agent.git`
- with no target, it fast-forwards the current or recoverable branch from `origin`
- with `--branch <branch>` or a branch positional target, it reattaches and updates that branch
- with a tag or commit target, it moves the current or recovered branch to that exact revision when possible
- it remains source-checkout only and does not update packaged Electron apps

## `serve`

`node space serve` starts the local runtime.

Current override forms:

- `PARAM=VALUE`
- `--host <host>`
- `--port <port>`

Launch-time override precedence is:

1. launch arguments
2. stored `.env` values written by `node space set`
3. process environment variables
4. schema defaults from `commands/params.yaml`

## Runtime Params Schema

The schema lives in `commands/params.yaml`.

Current params:

- `HOST`
- `PORT`
- `CUSTOMWARE_PATH`
- `SINGLE_USER_APP`
- `ALLOW_GUEST_USERS`
- `CUSTOMWARE_GIT_HISTORY`
- `USER_FOLDER_SIZE_LIMIT_BYTES`

Important fields per param:

- `description`
- `type`
- `allowed`
- `default`
- `frontend_exposed`

Only params with `frontend_exposed: true` are injected into page-shell meta tags for the frontend.

## Current High-Value Params

- `CUSTOMWARE_PATH`: parent directory that owns writable `L1/` and `L2/` roots
- `PORT`: accepts `0` when a caller wants the OS to assign a free local port at startup
- `SINGLE_USER_APP`: implicit always-authenticated `user` principal with virtual `_admin` access
- `ALLOW_GUEST_USERS`: enables guest creation from the login screen when password login is enabled
- `CUSTOMWARE_GIT_HISTORY`: enables optional debounced local Git history repositories for writable `L1/<group>/` and `L2/<user>/` roots; defaults to `false`; owner-root commits wait 10 seconds of quiet, then shorten to 5 seconds after 1 minute of pending writes, 1 second after 5 minutes, and immediate commit after 10 minutes
- `USER_FOLDER_SIZE_LIMIT_BYTES`: optional per-user `L2/<user>/` folder cap in bytes; `0` disables it, and positive values make app-file mutations reject projected growth over the cap while still allowing mutations that reduce an already-over-limit folder
- `user` and `group` commands flush pending local-history commits before returning when `CUSTOMWARE_GIT_HISTORY` is enabled because those commands are short-lived processes
- `node space set CUSTOMWARE_PATH <path>` should be run before creating users or groups when writable state should live outside the source checkout, because `user` and `group` commands resolve that stored parameter before deciding where `L1` and `L2` files belong

- Need server startup implications: `architecture/overview.md`
- Need writable-layer and permission effects: `server/customware-layers-and-paths.md`
