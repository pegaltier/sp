## Purpose

`_core/user_crypto/` owns session-scoped frontend decryption state for user-encrypted values.

It is a headless core module. It restores the current login's unlocked user key from browser session cache first and, when needed, from one encrypted `localStorage` blob protected by a session-derived backend key fetched from `/api/user_crypto_session_key`; it fails soft when the backend marks crypto missing or invalidated, logs the user out when the persisted local blob is stale for the current session, and exposes the stable `space.utils.userCrypto` runtime used by feature modules that need to encrypt small per-user secrets before persisting them into app files. In `SINGLE_USER_APP=true`, it short-circuits into a frontend bypass mode instead of attempting login-bound crypto bootstrap.

Documentation is top priority for this module. After any change under `_core/user_crypto/`, update this file, the affected parent docs, and the matching supplemental docs in the same session.

## Ownership

This scope owns:

- `user-crypto.js`: browser session-cache restore, encrypted localStorage restore, fail-soft encrypt/decrypt wrappers, password-rotation rewrap helper, and the exported runtime methods consumed through `space.utils.userCrypto`
- `ext/js/_core/framework/initializer.js/initialize/end/user-crypto.js`: authenticated bootstrap hook that restores the current login's unlocked user-crypto session before normal feature modules load

## Local Contracts

- the exported runtime surface is `space.utils.userCrypto`
- the module keeps the active tab's unlock state in `sessionStorage`, keyed by backend `sessionId` plus username
- the module may also keep one encrypted copy of that same cache entry in `localStorage` under a fixed origin-scoped key; the browser never stores the plaintext session-derived wrapping key at rest, and only the authenticated `user_crypto_session_key` endpoint may derive it from the current backend `sessionId` plus the server-held session secret
- the persistent per-user wrapped key record still stays in `~/meta/user_crypto.json`
- encrypted text payloads generated here must start with the literal `userCrypto:` prefix
- `decryptText(...)` must return plaintext unchanged when the input is not prefixed with `userCrypto:`, so legacy unencrypted values keep working during migration
- in `SINGLE_USER_APP=true`, `encryptText(...)` and `decryptText(...)` must return plaintext unchanged, `encryptBytes(...)` and `decryptBytes(...)` must return raw bytes unchanged, and the module must not attempt authenticated user-crypto bootstrap, logout recovery, or emit new `userCrypto:` payloads
- `decryptText(...)` returns `""` and `decryptBytes(...)` returns `new Uint8Array()` when crypto is unavailable, invalidated, or the payload does not decrypt with the active user key; those soft failures should log one concise `console.warn(...)` message instead of throwing through feature code
- when the backend reports `userCryptoState === "ready"` but no per-tab session cache exists, bootstrap should try the authenticated `user_crypto_session_key` endpoint plus the encrypted localStorage blob before warning that the current browser session is locked
- when the current tab already has an unlocked per-tab session cache, bootstrap should still best-effort call `user_crypto_session_key` so older authenticated tabs can backfill the encrypted localStorage blob without forcing a new password login
- if the encrypted localStorage blob exists but does not decrypt with the current authenticated session's derived wrapping key, bootstrap should treat it as stale leftover state, clear it, and sign the browser out
- when the authenticated backend reports `userCryptoState === "missing"`, bootstrap should first try one session-scoped recovery pass using the login page's temporary bootstrap secret and the authenticated `user_crypto_bootstrap` endpoint; if that recovery cannot run or fails, the authenticated bootstrap should sign the browser out so the next `/login` run can provision it cleanly
- when the backend reports `userCryptoState === "invalidated"`, bootstrap must not auto-regenerate a new user key because that would orphan previously encrypted values; the module should stay unavailable and warn instead
- password changes must reuse the current unlocked user master key and return a rewrapped `user_crypto.json` record for the new password without re-encrypting existing user data
- the browser session cache is keyed by backend session id plus username so multiple concurrent logins can keep separate unlocked session state without clobbering each other
- `clearSession()` must remove the current session's per-tab cache, the encrypted origin-scoped localStorage blob, and any login-bootstrap recovery secret before the caller navigates away or drops auth

## Development Guidance

- keep this module headless and runtime-focused
- keep actual crypto primitives in the shared browser helper served from `server/pages/res/user-crypto.js` so `/login` and authenticated app modules use the same envelope format and wrap derivation
- keep failure handling soft for callers and explicit in console output
- if the runtime namespace, session-cache format, bootstrap behavior, or `userCrypto:` envelope format changes, update this file, `/app/AGENTS.md`, `/app/L0/_all/mod/_core/framework/AGENTS.md`, and the matching docs under `_core/documentation/docs/`
